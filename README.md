# 🧠 Code Justice Initiative – Legal Case Parsers

**Empowering justice through open-source intelligence.**  
The Code Justice Initiative is building tools to help legal professionals and advocacy groups analyze human rights case law using modern coding technologies like Python, Node.js, and NLP.

## 🔍 What This Repo Is For

This repository contains **parsers** — small programs that read and clean up legal documents from courts like:

- ⚖️ International Criminal Court (ICC)
- 🇪🇺 European Court of Human Rights (ECHR)
- 🌎 Inter-American Court of Human Rights
- 🌍 African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights

Each parser helps pull out important facts from legal rulings:  
📅 case name, date, violated rights, affected groups, etc.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python** – For text parsing and automation
- **GitHub** – For tracking progress and collaboration
- **spaCy / NLTK** – Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries
- **Google Sheets + Refworld** – For datasets and legal sources
